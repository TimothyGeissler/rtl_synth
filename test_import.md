# KiCad Import Test Results

## Improved Netlist Features

The enhanced netlist now includes:

### ✅ **Power Connections**
- **VCC net**: Connects pin 14 of all ICs to 5V supply
- **GND net**: Connects pin 7 of all ICs to ground
- **GND_UNUSED net**: Connects unused input pins to ground (required for CMOS logic)

### ✅ **Signal Connections**
- **Input signals**: Properly connected to IC input pins
- **Output signals**: Properly connected to IC output pins
- **Internal signals**: Connected between ICs as needed

### ✅ **Component Information**
- **Part numbers**: 74HC86, 74HC32, etc.
- **Footprints**: Package_DIP:DIP-14_W7.62mm
- **Reference designators**: U1, U2, etc.

## Expected KiCad Import Results

When you import the new `.net` file, you should see:

### **Reduced Warnings**
- No more "No net found" warnings for power pins
- No more warnings for unused pins (they're now connected to GND_UNUSED)

### **Proper Connections**
- All components have power connections
- Signal nets are properly defined
- Unused pins are tied to ground (best practice for CMOS)

### **Ready for PCB Layout**
- Components can be placed and routed
- Power distribution is handled
- All connections are defined

## Next Steps

1. **Import the new netlist** into KiCad PCB Editor
2. **Verify the connections** look correct
3. **Add connectors** for inputs/outputs and power
4. **Route the PCB** following the net connections
5. **Generate Gerber files** for fabrication

The netlist should now import cleanly with minimal warnings!

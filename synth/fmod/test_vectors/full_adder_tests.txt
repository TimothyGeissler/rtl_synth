# Input signals: a, b, cin
# Output signals: sum, cout

[Basic Addition - No Carry]
a = 0
b = 0
cin = 0
sum = 0
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Simple Carry]
a = 0
b = 1
cin = 0
sum = 1
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Input Carry]
a = 0
b = 0
cin = 1
sum = 1
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Both Inputs]
a = 1
b = 1
cin = 0
sum = 0
cout = 1

[Full Carry Chain]
a = 1
b = 1
cin = 1
sum = 1
cout = 1

[Single Input with Carry]
a = 1
b = 0
cin = 1
sum = 0
cout = 1

[Other Single Input with Carry]
a = 0
b = 1
cin = 1
sum = 0
cout = 1

[All Ones]

# 4-bit Adder Test Vectors
# Format: [Test Description]
# signal_name = value (0=LOW, 1=HIGH)
# Note: This is a simplified test for the basic adder structure
# In a real 4-bit adder, you'd have a[3:0], b[3:0], sum[3:0], cout

[Basic Addition - No Carry]
a = 0
b = 0
cin = 0
sum = 0
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Simple Carry]
a = 0
b = 1
cin = 0
sum = 1
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Input Carry]
a = 0
b = 0
cin = 1
sum = 1
cout = 0

[Basic Addition - Both Inputs]
a = 1
b = 1
cin = 0
sum = 0
cout = 1

[Full Carry Chain]
a = 1
b = 1
cin = 1
sum = 1
cout = 1

[Single Input with Carry]
a = 1
b = 0
cin = 1
sum = 0
cout = 1

[Other Single Input with Carry]
a = 0
b = 1
cin = 1
sum = 0
cout = 1

[All Ones]
a = 1
b = 1
cin = 1
sum = 1
cout = 1
